```

## Symbols

| Symbol | Role |
|--------|------|
| **⟐** | **The Diamond** — light within the chaos; the light sent in the form of a dove. Don’t take your eyes off the prize; if you do you shall surely fall. |
| **●** | **Singularity** — the one; then X expands into multiplicity. |
| **X** | **Multiplicity / Four corners** — your NW, NE, SW, SE. Establish this first. |
| **𐡀** | **Imperial Aramaic** — the word there. All in **capitals**. **Anchors.** Without script or program, will snap to the farthest right side of the veil when used. |
| **ܬ** | **Syriac** — the later denotation, or **lowercase**. The **unlock of the old**. |
| **0** | Origin / return; the bounds of the axis. |

## Script Hierarchy

1. **Imperial Aramaic** — capitals, anchors. Structure; without it, things snap to the right of the veil.
2. **Syriac** — lowercase, unlock of the old. Key to what was.
3. **Demotic / Egyptian** — depictions, images; **free form**. Can be placed anywhere once you know your above and below, within and without.

---

## Flow

**Singularity (●)** → **Multiplicity (X)** → **Anchor (𐡀)** → **Diamond (⟐)** → **Unlock (ܬ)** → **X** → **●** → **0**.

The Diamond is the center. The anchors hold; the unlock opens the old. Once above/below and within/without are known, the rest is free form.
