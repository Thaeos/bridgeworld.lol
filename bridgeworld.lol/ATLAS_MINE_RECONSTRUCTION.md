# Atlas Mine Reconstruction Plan

## Context

**bridgeworld.lol** is the **community-maintained version** for governance and community content. The Atlas Mine was sunsetted in January 2023 per TIP-23, but we may need to reconstruct historical content for:
- Lore preservation
- Historical accuracy
- Community governance documentation

## Goal

Piece together Atlas Mine content from:
1. Wayback Machine snapshots (pre-Jan 2023)
2. treasure-docs repository
3. Historical references in repos
4. TIP-23 discussion details

## Sources to Check

### 1. Wayback Machine Snapshots
- `bridgeworld.treasure.lol` (before Jan 2023)
- `docs.bridgeworld.treasure.lol` (before Jan 2023)
- Look for Atlas Mine pages, staking guides, gameplay content

### 2. TIP-23 Discussion
- URL: https://gov.treasure.lol/discussion/8902-tip23-atlas-mine-cataclysm-sunset
- Contains details about why/how it was sunsetted
- May have migration information

### 3. Repository Content
- `/mnt/Vault/TreasureProject/about-treasure/governance/README.md` - Mentions sunset
- `/mnt/Vault/TreasureProject/references/contracts/README.md` - Contract addresses
- Historical commits in treasure-docs

### 4. Current Bridgeworld.lol Content
- Lore chapter about Atlas Mine (historical/lore context)
- Gameplay references (need updating)
- Meta descriptions (need updating)

## Reconstruction Strategy

### Option A: Historical Documentation
- Keep Atlas Mine in lore as historical context
- Add note: "The Atlas Mine was sunsetted in January 2023 (TIP-23)"
- Update gameplay to reflect current mechanics (Harvesters only)
- Preserve historical content for community reference

### Option B: Full Reconstruction
- Use Wayback Machine to recover full Atlas Mine content
- Document the complete feature as it existed
- Create historical archive section
- Update current gameplay to remove active references

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Keep lore content (already historical)
- Reconstruct gameplay mechanics from snapshots
- Document migration path (Atlas Mine → Harvesters)
- Update meta tags to reflect current state

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fetch TIP-23 discussion details
2. ⏳ Search Wayback Machine for snapshots
3. ⏳ Extract historical Atlas Mine content
4. ⏳ Compare with current Bridgeworld.lol content
5. ⏳ Decide on reconstruction approach
6. ⏳ Update content accordingly

## Notes

- bridgeworld.lol is community-governed
- Historical accuracy is important for lore
- Current gameplay should reflect active features only
- Community may want to preserve historical content
