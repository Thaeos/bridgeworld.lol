- **Status**: ✅ Retrieved
- **Content**: Next.js application (minimal HTML, React-rendered)
- **Note**: This is just before the January 2023 sunset

## What We Found

### From 2022 Snapshot:
- Atlas Mine was an **interactive location** on the Bridgeworld map
- Located at coordinates: `left:51.5%;top:47%` on the world map
- Part of the interactive game interface
- Users could click on it to access staking functionality

### Historical Context:
- The site was a Next.js/React application
- Interactive map with clickable locations
- Atlas Mine was one of the main gameplay locations
- Other locations included: marketplace, barracks, pilgrimage, summon, craft, quest

## What We Still Need

1. **Atlas Mine Staking Interface** - What did the staking UI look like?
2. **Mechanics Documentation** - Detailed staking mechanics from before sunset
3. **Migration Details** - How players migrated from Atlas Mine to Harvesters
4. **Historical Screenshots** - Visual references of the feature

## Next Steps for Reconstruction

1. Try to access specific Atlas Mine pages from docs
2. Search for historical gameplay guides
3. Look for community documentation about Atlas Mine mechanics
4. Check if there are any archived images or screenshots

## Notes

- Wayback Machine snapshots show the site structure but React content needs JavaScript
- May need to search for static documentation or archived guides
- Community forums or Discord archives might have more details
