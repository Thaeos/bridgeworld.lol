# Treasure DAO Community Intentions & Capabilities

## Key Findings from Documentation

### 1. Community-Driven Philosophy

**From README.md:**
> "Treasure is a fair-launch, community-driven project. The vast majority of Treasure's team members came directly from the community, inspired by Treasure's ethos of building in the open and with transparency."

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Community members can become core contributors
- ✅ Open source and transparent building
- ✅ Community can build alongside the team
- ✅ Rewards in MAGIC for ecosystem contributions

### 2. Community Grants Program

**750k MAGIC** earmarked for community contributions in first year.

**Grantable Categories:**
1. **Infrastructure & Tooling** - UI, dashboards, tooling
2. **Education - Guides, Content, and Resources** - How-to guides, educational initiatives
3. **Creative - Art, Storytelling & World-building** - Lore, storytelling, art
4. **Localization** - Translation of resources
5. **Other** - Other community-driven initiatives

### 3. Governance Structure

1. Submit TIP (Treasure Improvement Proposal) on forum
2. Community discussion and engagement
3. Snapshot voting (gMAGIC holders)
4. Implementation by DAO

**Criteria for Snapshot Vote:**
- Live for at least one day
- At least 5 posts from different members

- At least one DAO Council member aware

**Who Can Vote:**
- MAGIC stakers (Harvesters and Governance Staking)

### 4. Community Contributions

**From README.md:**
> "The DAO has established a framework by which the community can build alongside the team and receive rewards in MAGIC for developing key parts of the ecosystem (e.g., tooling, lore, quests)."

**Open Source:**
> "Treasure itself is open source. The marketplace, quests, and lore are publicly-hosted projects to which anyone can contribute."

**Contributions Include:**
- Tooling
- Lore
- Quests
- Educational resources
- Analytics
- Infrastructure

### 5. Decentralization Philosophy

**Key Quote:**
> "Decentralization solves a crucial scaling problem. There is no way the team (no matter the size) can scrape together a **collective imagination** sufficient to construct the entirety of this metaverse. Decentralization, therefore, creates the conditions by which a true metaverse can develop and be **free of proprietary distortion**."
